**Pioneer is a space adventure game set in our galaxy at the turn of the 33rd century.**

The game is open-ended, and you are free to eke out whatever kind of space-faring existence you can think of. Explore and trade between millions of star systems. Turn to a life of crime as a pirate, smuggler or bounty hunter. Travel through vast territories of various factions, experience beautiful scenery, be the first to witness foreign stars being eclipsed by alien worlds. The universe is whatever you make of it.

Pioneer is under constant development and has a friendly community of players, modders and developers around it. We'd love for you to try it and make part of the galaxy your own!
