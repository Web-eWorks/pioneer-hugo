# Download Pioneer

We regularly produce builds of Pioneer to make it easy for players to try out recent developments and to get feedback and ideas. We'd love for you to take Pioneer for a spin. These are unfinished development snapshots, and are lots of fun!

## Binary builds

Pre-built copies of the game are available for the following platforms. (See [GitHub releases](https://github.com/pioneerspacesim/pioneer/releases) for older releases)

## Source code

Complete source for the game, including assets, is always available from our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pioneerspacesim/pioneer).

See the [compiling guide](https://github.com/pioneerspacesim/pioneer/blob/master/COMPILING.txt) to find out how to get it up and running.
